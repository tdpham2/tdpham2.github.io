Greetings! I am Thang Pham, a Ph.D. candidate in the Snurr group in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University. My research has been focused on material discovery, with interfaces between molecular simulations, optimization techniques, and machine learning. My expertise is at the intersection of theoretical research and its real-world applications, as I adeptly bridge the gap between these two domains.

I have worked on diverse topics, including carbon dioxide capture, hydrogen storage, water harvesting and photocatalysis. By employing innovative and data-driven methodologies, I strive to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of these pressing issues. My goal is to pioneer solutions that have a tangible impact on society, showcasing the power of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing the challenges of our time.
