Greetings! I am Thang Pham, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Snurr group in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University. My passion lies in the realm of material discovery, where I delve into the intricate interplay between molecular simulations, optimization techniques, and machine learning algorithms. My expertise shines at the intersection of theoretical research and its real-world applications, as I adeptly bridge the gap between these two domains.

In my research journey, I have dedicated my efforts to unraveling complex challenges. I have focused on diverse projects, including carbon dioxide capture, hydrogen storage, and water harvesting. By employing innovative and data-driven methodologies, I strive to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of these pressing issues. My goal is to pioneer solutions that have a tangible impact on society, showcasing the power of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing the challenges of our time.
