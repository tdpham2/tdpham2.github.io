My name is Thang Pham. I am a Ph.D. candidate in prof. Randall Snurr group in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University. My research have been focused on material discovery, with interfaces between molecular simulations, optimization and machine learning. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, employing data-driven methodologies to address real-world challenges. I have worked on projects related to carbon dioxide capture, hydrogen storage and water harvesting.
